 If this text does not get replaced by a
  <br> message telling  <b>arsub_es6.js</b> was loaded
 <br> and  tests ran successfully  then there
 <br> was some problem loading arsub_es6.js.
 <p>
  Use the browser dev-tools <b>console</b> to
  <br>   see what could   be  the problem.

 <p>  arsub_es6.js will not run on older browsers
 <br> only on ES6 -capable ones.
 <p>
  Also note you typically can not load
 <br>ES6 modules  from the file-system
 <br> due to security reasons,  you need to
 <br>serve this test-page from a server.
